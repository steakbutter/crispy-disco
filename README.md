# Crispy Logo Maker

## Description
'Crispy Logo Maker' is an application made with node to create a logo.svg file after filling out the questions asked by the inquirer NPM. <br>
I decided to work on this project to help me create a logo and avoid paying for one. <br>
I learned that node.js can be a very useful tool to dynamically create files by filling out information using the inquirer npm.
